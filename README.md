🚀 AI-Based Content Marketing Optimizer

Repo for AI-Powered Marketing Automation Project

A next-generation, fully automated intelligence layer for digital marketing — engineered to generate, refine, evaluate, and continuously improve content using LLMs, sentiment engines, ML pipelines, and seamless integrations.

🌟 Overview

The AI-Based Automated Content Marketing Optimizer is an end-to-end system designed to elevate the entire digital content lifecycle.

Instead of manually crafting, testing, and adjusting content, this platform automates the full journey:

AI-generated content using LLaMA / Gemini models

Sentiment & emotion understanding

Trend-aware content enhancement

A/B performance comparison

Real-time analytics & metric logging

ML-powered performance predictions

Automated retraining for continuous model improvement

Multiple intelligence components work together to create a smart, self-learning content engine that becomes better with every execution cycle.

🎛️ What the System Brings Together

LLM-Driven Content Generation (LLaMA + Gemini APIs)

Emotion + Sentiment Analysis Engine for tone & audience perception

Trend Optimization Layer to adapt content to real-time topics

A/B Variant Coach for probability-based winner prediction

Slack Alerts for instant performance updates

Google Sheets Sync for logging, analytics & traceability

Auto-Retrainer to refresh ML models using new campaign data

Interactive Streamlit Dashboard for insights, monitoring & manual control

🎯 Key Objectives
✔️ Fully Automated Content Pipeline

Generate, score, and optimize content using LLMs + sentiment analysis + trend signals — entirely hands-free.

✔️ Predictive Content Intelligence

Leverages historical metrics & A/B results to forecast which content will deliver superior performance.

✔️ Continuous ML Model Retraining

The system adapts by learning from engagement metrics, sentiment outputs, and A/B results — ensuring long-term accuracy.

✔️ Centralized Dashboard & Insights

A clean Streamlit interface that unifies content creation, evaluation, metrics tracking, A/B analysis, and ML training controls.
