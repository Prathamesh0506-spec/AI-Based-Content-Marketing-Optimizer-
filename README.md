AI-Based Content Marketing Optimizer

Repo for AI-Powered Marketing Automation Project

A next-generation, fully automated intelligence layer for digital marketing — built to generate, refine, evaluate, and continuously improve content using LLMs, sentiment engines, ML-driven insights, and seamless integrations.

🚀 Overview
The AI-Based Automated Content Marketing Optimizer is a unified, end-to-end system that elevates the entire content marketing workflow.
